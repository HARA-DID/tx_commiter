# worker-service

A production-ready Go worker that consumes events from **Redis Streams**, stores
job state in **PostgreSQL**, and executes blockchain transactions via a **Composite SDK Adapter** (DID Root, Verifiable Credentials, Alias) with **Account Abstraction (AA)** routing.

## HNS Contract Resolution

This project exclusively uses **Handshake (HNS)** for contract resolution. There are no hardcoded addresses or manual ABI configurations.
All adapters use `NewXXXWithHNS` or `ContractWithHNS` to resolve dependencies at startup via the `AA_ENTRYPOINT_HNS`, `DID_VC_FACTORY_HNS`, and other HNS environment variables.

## Environment Variables

| `PRIVATE_KEY`       | ✅       | Hex-encoded wallet private key                        |
| `AA_ENTRYPOINT_HNS` | ✅       | HNS URI for the Accountant Abstraction EntryPoint     |

| `SERVER_PORT`       | ❌       | Port for health and metrics (Default: 8080)           |

## Processing Flow

For each Redis stream message the worker:

1. **Parses** the raw stream entry into `domain.Event`.
2. **Validates** the event (id present, type recognised, payload non-empty).
3. **Idempotency check** — queries `jobs` table by `event_id`; skips if already `success`.
4. **Creates** a `pending` job row in PostgreSQL.
5. **Encodes** the transaction data by mapping domain payloads to SDK-specific `Params`.
6. **Dispatches** via the **AA EntryPoint** (`HandleOps`) with retry + exponential backoff.
7. **Updates** the job row to `success` (with tx hashes) or `failed` (with error).
8. **ACKs** the message if successful; pushes to DLQ and ACKs if retries are exhausted.

## Observability

### Health check

```
GET http://localhost:8080/healthz
→ 200 {"status":"ok"}
```

### Prometheus metrics

```
GET http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

Key metrics:

| Metric                                  | Type      | Description                              |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `worker_events_received_total`          | Counter   | Events read from Redis                   |
| `worker_events_processed_total{status}` | Counter   | Events by outcome: success/failed/skipped|
| `worker_events_retried_total`           | Counter   | Total retry attempts                     |
| `worker_events_dlq_total`               | Counter   | Events routed to DLQ                     |
| `worker_event_process_duration_seconds` | Histogram | End-to-end processing latency            |

## Horizontal Scaling

Each replica **must** have a unique `CONSUMER_NAME`. With the default
`worker-<hostname>` value, Kubernetes pods get unique names automatically.

All replicas join the **same consumer group** — Redis Streams guarantees
each message is delivered to exactly one consumer in the group.

```yaml
# k8s Deployment excerpt
env:
  - name: CONSUMER_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.name   # e.g. worker-service-7d9f8b-xkqp2
```

## Running Tests

```bash
make test       # all tests with race detector
make cover      # coverage HTML report → coverage.html
```

## Architecture Decisions

**SDK Isolation**: The `internal/sdk/` directory is the **only** entry point for third-party SDK dependencies (DID, VC, Alias, AA). The rest of the application interacts with the blockchain via a high-level `BlockchainService` interface, ensuring that business logic remains independent of specific SDK implementations.

**Composite SDK Pattern**: A `CompositeAdapter` acts as a router, delegating jobs to specific SDK adapters based on the event type. This allows the system to scale its capabilities (e.g., adding a new credential type) by simply adding a new adapter without modifying the core worker loop.

**Account Abstraction (AA) Integration**: All write operations follow an **Encode-then-Dispatch** pattern. Specific adapters (DID, VC, Alias) encode their parameters into binary calldata, which is then passed to the `AAAdapter`. The `AAAdapter` dispatches these through the EntryPoint's `HandleOps`, centralizing gas management and wallet abstraction.

**HNS-Only Configuration**: We've eliminated manual contract addresses and ABIs in favor of a **Handshake (HNS)** resolution model. This ensures that the worker always resolves the correct contract instances at runtime, reducing configuration errors and simplifying deployments across different environments (dev/test/prod).

**Event Idempotency**: To prevent double-processing of events, we combine an application-level check with a database-level `unique_event_id` constraint. Each job is tracked in PostgreSQL, and once successful, it cannot be re-executed.

**ACK-after-Success/DLQ Policy**: Messages are only acknowledged in Redis after a successful blockchain transaction or after being successfully pushed to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). This guarantees no events are lost due to transient failures or logic errors.
